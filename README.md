This treebank's corpus consists of texts of Turkic script or sentences that are trivially convertible. Trivially
convertible is defined as follows: the transliterated sentence is from a collection written before the
19th century, or closely matches Turkic-script sentences' structure and semantics. For Turkic
script texts, the letter variate choice must match the original.
